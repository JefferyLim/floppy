#Floppy

This project was an independent project done in Spring 2017 with Professor Shalom Ruben of the CU Boulder Mechanical Engineering department. 

The goal of this project was to reconstruct the floppy drive orchestra and understand how to produce music with floppy drives and finding a way to drive them using the MIDI file format. 

The report goes through the design process of what was used and the design process.
