\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of the floppy drive orchestra is to both develop a working orchestra with several floppy drives and to understand what allows the floppy drive orchestra function properly. Floppy drives are a hardware device invented in 1967 that was used to read and write information. THese floppy drives are now considered antique in the computer hardware world, and there is not much functionality to these drives. Several people, however, have abused the floppy drive to try and produce music from them, and thus, the floppy drive orchestra was born. \\

To understand the floppy drives, several tests were conducted to test their power consumption, physical limitation of the read/write head, and what ranges of frequencies does it play. The hardware to enable several floppy drives is explored, as well as the hardware on the Arduino. The MIDI, or musical instrument digital interface, is a special format that gives lots of information. Finally, the software to play music, as well as the software on the Arduino will be explored. 

\chapter{Floppy Drive Characteristics}

The first tests conducted were the analysis of a single floppy drive unit. Floppy drives come in three sizes: 8 in., 5.25 in., and 3.5 in. The large floppy drives come with different characteristics, however, the more modern 3.5 in. floppy drive will be used in this orchestra. The five characteristics to be explored are pinouts, power, stepper motor movements, stepper motor bandwidth, and frequency.

    \caption{Floppy Drive of All Sizes}
    \label{fig:sizes}
\end{figure}


\section{Floppy Pinout}

The floppy pinout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pinOut}. The bottom row, or the odd valued pins, are all grounded, where the top pins, or the even valued pins, are live. Each pin has a diferent functionality when it is grounded with the pins below. It is not necessary to connect the live pins to their respected ground pins, because the bottom row are all grounded. The actual names of the active pins are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pinNames}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\hspace*{-2cm}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{floppy_pinout.jpg}
    \caption{Floppy Drive Pinout}
    \label{fig:pinOut}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\hspace*{-2cm}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{pinNames.png}
    \caption{Floppy Drive Pin Names}
    \label{fig:pinNames}
\end{figure}

The only necessary pins to drive the floppy drive are pin number 12 or 14, 18, and 20. Pins 12 and 14 are the drive select B and A repectively. These are the drive enable pins. Some drives are B drives and others are A. In order to see the drive letter, connect pin 12 or 14 to one of the pin bottom pins: the LED will turn on for one drive letter. These pins are equivalent to an enable pin.\\

Pin 18 is a direction pin. The direction is what determines the direction of the motor drive. When the pin is grounded, the drive heads moves away from the pins, and when the pin is high, the drive returns towards the pins. \\

Pin 20 is a step pin. This pin drives the stepper motor. Every time the pin goes high, the stepper motor will go forward one tick.\\

\section{Power}

The floppy drive takes a mini Molex cable as seen in Figure \ref{fig:miniMolex}. A mini Molex cable has 4 different lines, one red, one yellow, and two black. The two black wires are grounded, where the red line is 5V and the yellow is 12V. Older generation floppy drives used both the 5V and 12V, where the 12V was used to power the stepper motor. The modern floppy drives no longer use the 12V for stepper motors, and only use 5V. For the final floppy drive hardware, this results in only needing a 5V rail to power all of the floppy drives.

\begin{figure}[H]
\hspace*{-2cm}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{miniMolex.jpg}
    \caption{Floppy Drive Power Pinout}
    \label{fig:miniMolex}
\end{figure}


The power consumption was measured by using jumper cables to connect the floppy drives to a power supply, through an ampmeter. Pin 12 is grounded, to enable drive B. When the drive is not running, the ampmeter measured 50 mA. To test when active, pin 20 is connected to a function generator, generating a square wave. Pin 18 is grounded and set to high appropriately in order to allow the stepper motor to switch back and forth. When active, the floppy drive pulls 400 mA. The function generator was swept from all frequencies in order to see if a change in frequency would affect the current consumption, however, no change was made. This means that at most, each floppy drive requires around 400 mA. \\

\section{Stepper Motor Movement}

\begin{figure}[H]
\hspace*{-2cm}    
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{floppydrive_coveroff.jpg}
    \caption{Floppy Drive With Top Off}
    \label{fig:coveroff}
\end{figure}

The floppy drive read/write head has a physical limit to how far it can go. To determine this value, a 1 Hz square wave is sent through to the floppy drive's direction pin (pin 18). Pin 12 is grounded, and pin 18 is set to ground. The number of ticks is manually recorded by counting the number of audible ticks that can be heard, with the last value is when the read/write head does not move. This can be run multiple times by simply disconnected or connecting the direction pin, or pin 18. \\

The total number of ticks a 3.5 in. drive can go is 80, meaning the step pin (pin 20) needs to be toggled high 80 times before the drive reaches the limit. This means there needs to be a transition of high to low 80 times, or a total of 160 voltage transitions. Depending on the floppy drive, the motor will react differently when the read/write head reaches its limit. The head will either try and move, causing an audible ticking, while others will not move. \\

\section{Stepper Motor Bandwidth}

Since the music will be played through the read/write head, the bandwidth of the stepper motor will be a large limiting factor. For the test, a square wave from a waveform generator is connected to the step pin (pin 20), and the direction pin is connected to ground and disconnected in order to allow the read/write head to switch direction. \\

The waveform generator is swepted from 1 Hz up until the read/write head is no longer moving. The drive was able to handle up to 400 Hz, but afterwords, it was no longer consistent in terms of the speed of the drive. This test is ran again when the software was fully written. This made a significant difference because the motor was able to run at a much higher input frequency. \\

This limit considerably restricts what the drive can play, and higher notes will need to be addressed. However, so far, there is an assumption that the audible range contains the input frequency given to the stepper motor. In the next section, audio files of the floppy drives at each frequency are recorded and transformed. \\

\section{Frequency}

Although the floppy drive was unable to run past 400 Hz, it is also important to take a look at the actual audio produced from the floppy drive. 


\chapter{Hardware}

In this chapter, the hardware setup of the orchestra is built.

\section{Power}


As discussed in the previous chapter on floppy drive power characteristics, since each floppy drive, when running, draws 400 mA. For each floppy drive added to the system, the total power draw increases by 400 mA, so for 4 floppy drives, the total power consumption from the floppy drive system would be around 1600 mA, or 1.6 A.

\chapter{MIDI Files}

MIDI, or Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a standard that has its own protocols, interface, and connectors. It allows a single file to contain multiple tracks for several instruments in its own channel. This allows a MIDI file to play several instruments at once, up to a maximum of 16 instruments. This advantage of the MIDI file allows multiple floppy drives to be played at once, like how a MIDI file would send data to several instruments. 

\section{MIDI Notes}

The MIDI interface has notes that are mapped to specific piano keys at their respected frequencies.

\chapter{Software}

In order to run the software, there needs to be information to be sent from a computer to the arduino. 

\section{Using a PC}

The data flow path of the driver is as following. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]

\node (block) [block] {MIDI Player};
\node (block1) [block, right of=block, xshift=2cm] {MIDI Driver};
\node (block2) [block, right of=block1, xshift=2cm] {Serial Driver};
\node (block3) [block, right of=block2, xshift=2cm] {Arduino Serial};

\draw [arrow] (block) -- (block1);
\draw [arrow] (block1) -- (block2);
\draw [arrow] (block2) -- (block3);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\subsection{MIDI Player}

The MIDI player takes in a MIDI file and play the music. 

\subsection{MIDI to Serial Driver}

The MIDI to serial driver is a key player in getting music to play on the floppy drives. The driver turns the MIDI outputs from the player, into data that is transmitted using serial. The driver used for this project was Hairless MIDI to Serial Bridge, found at \url{http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/}. \\

This project has platforms for all three operating systems and has a GUI that is easy to interface with as evident in \ref{fig:hairless}. The Serial<->MIDI Bridge On turns the driver on or off, being helpful with programming the arduino since the arduino requires the serial port to be programmed. The Serial Port drop down menu will have the name of the Arduino or the COM port being used by the arduino. The MIDI In drop down menu is where the MIDI player should be located. \\

    \caption{Hairless MIDISerial}
    \label{fig:hairless}
\end{figure} 

\section{Arduino}

The code written for the project was done entirely in arduino. 

\section{SD Card(?)}

\chapter{Arduino}

\section{Parameters}
There are several global parameters used in order to do the control of the floppy drives. Each parameter are arrays of a set size, set specifically to the number of floppy drives in the system. For example, array[0] would be for the first floppy drive, and array[1] would be for the second. 

\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=16, lastline=36]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

The first two arrays are stepPins and dirPins, an array of the pin numbers for the step and direction pins of the floppy drive. \\

The array headPos stands for head position of each floppy drive. This number is to keep track of how far the head of the floppy drive is. Once it reaches the maximum number, the direction pin is flipped to move the head the other direction. \\

The array notePeriod is the requested period for the specific drive. The software will use this number as reference to know how often the floppy drive should be moving.\\

The array periodCounter is a counter used to keep a counter to match the requested period to the current period. \\

The next two booleans are driveState and driveDir. These keeps track of the current state of the pins that are driving the step and direction pin. These pins are changed as necessary depending on the period counter and the head position. \\

The last 4 parameters are each bytes that will contain the bytes received from serial. \\

\section{Timer1 Library}

The purpose of the timer library is to enable timer interrupts. Timer interrupts are software interrupts that stop the processor to address some service at a certain time. The way the library works is it utilizes timer1 of the arduino and sets a resolution. This resolution determines how often the timer triggers an interrupt. If the value is set to 100 us, it will trigger every 100 us. An ISR or interrupt service routine will run a specific code.

\section{Setup}

In the setup section of the arduino code, the arduino runs through a couple of steps to properly ensure that the system is ready to go. The first step it goes through is initializing all the parameters to their proper values. \\


\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=44,lastline=57]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

The next step is to generate the note lookup table. This is generated by first generating the frequency value of each MIDI note. The equation can be seen in the code, as well as on the wikipedia page on MIDI tuning standards: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_tuning_standard}. \\


\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=59,lastline=65]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

The note lookup calculates the half period of each note and turns the frequency into seconds. \\

\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=67,lastline=70]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

The next section forces all the drives to reset and moves the read/write head back to the starting position. \\

\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=72,lastline=95]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

Finally, timer1 is initialized with the appropriate service function. 

\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=99,lastline=100]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

\section{Serial Reader}

The MIDI to serial driver sends MIDI data over serial, which is then used to set the proper note period. The data flow goes as following. \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]

\node (start) [startstop] {Initialize};
\node (process) [process, below of=start] {Wait for Serial};
\node (io) [io, below of=process] {MIDI Bytes};
\node (process1) [process, right of=io, xshift=3cm] {Set Note Period};


\draw [arrow] (start) -- (process);
\draw [arrow] (process) -- (io);
\draw [arrow] (io) -- (process1);
\draw [arrow] (process1) |- (process);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This loop is represented in the loop function of the arduino. This code is continously waiting for serial data, and then it is parsed. 


\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=106,lastline=126]{../src/floppy/floppy.ino}

\section{ISR}

The ISR or interrupt service routine is the routine that gets called every time the interrupt from the timer1 is triggered. The specific code run during this time is the code that does the driving of the floppy drives. 

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]

\node (start) [startstop] {Start};
\node (process) [process, right of=start, xshift=2cm] {Check Drive Num};
\node (decision) [decision, right of=process, xshift=2cm] {Req. Period};
\node (process1) [process, below of=decision, yshift=-2cm] {period counter = 0};
\node (process2) [process, right of=process1, xshift=2cm] {period counter++};
\node (decision1) [decision, below of=process2, yshift=-2cm] {period counter};
\node (process3) [process, below of=decision1, yshift=-2cm] {Drive output};
\node (decision2) [decision, below of=process3, yshift=-2cm] {Head Position};
\node (process4) [process, below of=decision2, yshift=-2cm] {Turn Head Around};


\draw [arrow] (start) -- (process);
\draw [arrow] (process) -- (decision);
\draw [arrow] (decision) -- node[anchor=west] {== 0} (process1);
\draw [arrow] (decision) -| node[anchor=south] {$>$ 0} (process2);

\draw [arrow] (process2) -- (decision1);

\draw [arrow] (process3) -- (decision2);
\draw [arrow] (decision2) -| node[anchor=east] {$<$ 180} (process);
\draw [arrow] (decision2) --  node[anchor=east] {$>=$ 180}  (process4);
\draw [arrow] (process4) -|(process);
